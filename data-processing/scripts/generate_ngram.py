# this script builds a word-level n-gram dictionary from a given text file.
# each n-gram maps to a list of words that follow it.
# you can use this script with this command: python3 generate_ngram.py [path/to/text/file] [n]

# Learned these concepts during my bachelors degree.
# I adapted the n-gram generation algorithm from class, to a word gram in python
